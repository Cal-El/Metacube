(Version numbers: http://semver.org/)

1.1.0:
Features:
  - Skinned meshes are now supported for "half through the portal"
    appearance cloning.
  - Added TeleportController. This allows you to hook and customize
    teleporting for objects.
  - Added a round portal mesh and frame. Try out the
    BidirectionalRoundPortalPair prefab.
  - If you need to disable oblique clipping planes, such as for realtime
    shadows, there is now a helper script (HideBehindPortal) and
    instructions (in the Readme) for automatically  hiding geometry
    behind portals.
  - Readme cleanup/updates, incl. notes on how to get lighting panel
    fog working.

Changes:
  - Normalized directory layout.
  - Removed an uninteresting image from Sources.zip.

Fixes:
  - Unity 5.x character controllers (regular and rigidbody) now rotate
    correctly when traveling through portals.
  - Fixed a bug causing a one-frame visibility gap for teleported objects.
  - Don't disable occlusion culling if we aren't using an oblique frustum.
  - Fixed an incorrect default value on a prefab.
  - Demo works in Unity 5.0.0 now.
